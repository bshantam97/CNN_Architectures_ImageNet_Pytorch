# CNN Architectures Implementation using Pytorch

Deep Learning Software Required: Pytorch, numpy, os

### Architectures Implemented

1. AlexNet
2. GoogleNet
3. ResNet
4. Xception
5. DenseNet
6. VGGNet

### About the Dataset
The dataset contains Images of Cats and Dogs and the Architectures Implemented in Pytorch has to differentiate between a Cat and a Dog.
The dataset contains real images and one can learn about data augmentation and implementation of different CNN Architectures on a real image dataset. The dataset is similar to the one that can be found on ImageNet.
